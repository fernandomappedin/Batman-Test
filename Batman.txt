Batman

You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible.

I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil.

You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.

Search him. Then I will kill you.

This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

Although I'm not ordinary, I'm a citizen.

Gordon... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.

You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake.

I honour my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience.

When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back. It's admirable, but mistaken.

Didn't you get the memo?

Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.

The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act.

Okay. Now... Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped, ti-weave fibres for flexibility. You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

You can swap-not sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.
